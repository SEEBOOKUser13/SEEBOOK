    <h2><strong>More about the different Sections of SEEBOOK: </strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>SEEBOOK Public: SEEBOOK Public is a place where all your messages are seen as public to everyone who logs onto that section. It's only 1 server, and can have hundreds of users on it as the same time. In this section you can chat and talk with other people from your or different schools. It's an opportunity to learn more about people and help others!</li>
      <li>SEEBOOK Private: This section of SEEBOOK is a bit more private, only people with a code can enter your server. You can create or join servers, and unlike a Public Server, Private Servers have a capacity. At the most 50 users can be in 1 private server. Here you can invite others into your server and chat.</li>
      <li>SEEBOOK Post: SEEBOOK Post is a bit different. It's 1 server with no limit of users, but you can send a priavte or public message. Here, you can also send images and videos, as long as they don't violate the SEEBOOK Image. It's a place where you can send quick posts and so that everyone can see your message as a formal post, rather than a message or private message.</li>
      <li>SEEBOOK Clubs: Here is SEEBOOK Clubs, you can see a list of different clubs that you could join. You can also create your own club, by emailing the President of SEEBOOK, Ms. Vince. Clubs must have an adult supervisor and a President.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Servers are constantly monitored to make sure peace is maintained, though in the next year, we suspect there will be no need for that. For, we could have a system, like a TextFinder, that inspects the message and sees if it's appropriate before the message is sent.</strong></p>
