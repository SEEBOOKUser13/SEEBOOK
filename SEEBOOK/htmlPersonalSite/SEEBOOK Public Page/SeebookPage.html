<ul>
  <li>SEEBOOK Public: As you can guess, SEEBOOK Public have servers where everyone who logs in can see what you typed.</li>
  <li>SEEBOOK Private: Now unlike SEEBOOK Public, private server messages can only be seen by the people invited into that server, which means not everyone can see it. That doesn't mean it's still not monitored by our staff.</li>
  <li>SEEBOOK Post: SEEBOOK Post on the other hand, can be private or public. It's used for quick posts or notices.</li>
  <li>SEEBOOK Clubs: The club part of SEEBOOK is where you can join or create your own club. Such as, the book club. They have their own terms and rules within their club, but if a rule disobeys SEEBOOK, the club will be shut down immediately.</li>
</ul>
